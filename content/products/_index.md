Our offset analytics platform is the the de facto research tool for professionals seeking to maximize offset purchase efficiency.  There’s no comparable mechanism out there for performing data analysis across registries.  Data fields are homogenized across registries to ensure apples-to-apples comparisons. Our smart database structures and aggregates information from 14,696 projects across 5 major registries, representing 2,341 unique project developers operating in 151 countries.  

In total, we have clean data underpinning more than 3 billion credits.  Fields within our database, of course, include projects by sector, by geography, by developer, etc., and attributes of underlying credits such as registry, year, vintage, methodology, ownership…  But we also have fields in a structured and cleaned format for dates of project commissioning, verification, credit issuance, along with project crediting periods, telephone numbers for the point of contact at the developer of each project, their surveyors, the verification body involved, and more.  These fields are unavailable elsewhere in a structured form.
